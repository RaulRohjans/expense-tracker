/*
 * This is a funy one.
 *
 * The UI package used, NuxtUI has position relative on ALL
 * inputs and input groups, they hammered that on all the containers
 * and elements they could.
 *
 * This causes the fields to display over the user dropdown menu, so we
 * use this to hammer it back to static
 *
 * Im starting to regret using this library...
